# Current-Emerging-Trends
In this project, I worked on developing an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game where a pirate navigates a maze to find treasure. The starter code provided included two Python classes: TreasureMaze.py, representing the environment as a matrix, and GameExperience.py, storing episodes for experience-based learning. The code also included a partially implemented Jupyter Notebook that outlined the setup of the maze, the agent's movement, and a skeleton for the deep Q-learning algorithm.

My contribution involved completing the deep Q-learning implementation. Specifically, I wrote the code to train the pirate agent to navigate the maze and find the optimal path to the treasure using reinforcement learning. This involved implementing the logic for selecting actions, updating the Q-values, and training the neural network model. Additionally, I tested and tuned the model to achieve a high win rate for the pirate agent.

Computer scientists design, analyze, and implement algorithms that solve complex problems. They work on creating efficient solutions for tasks ranging from simple data processing to intricate AI systems like the pirate intelligent agent. This work matters because it powers everything from everyday applications to advanced technologies like autonomous systems, improving how we interact with and understand the world.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first thoroughly understanding the problem domain and breaking down the problem into manageable components. I then explore various algorithms and data structures that could effectively solve the problem. For this project, I identified deep Q-learning as the appropriate approach for the pathfinding problem and systematically implemented and tested this solution to achieve optimal results.

My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the algorithms and systems I develop are fair, reliable, and secure. It's essential to consider the potential impacts on users and society, avoiding biases, and ensuring that the system respects user privacy and data integrity. For the organization, I must maintain transparency in my work, follow best practices, and ensure the solutions I create align with the organization's goals while being mindful of long-term consequences.
